## ðŸ“– DESCRIPTION

### ðŸŽ¯ What is it about?

- An application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected
- They can choose to include up to 4 categories of characters:  
  1-lowercased characters  
  2-uppercased characters  
  3-numeric characters  
  4-special characters  

### Preview

## ðŸ’» USAGE

[Visit the webpage here](https://senseilein.github.io/password-generator)

This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS (provided starter code) powered by JavaScript code that I've written. It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

### ðŸ’¬ User story

```
As a user,
I WANT to use the app,
SO THAT I can generate passwords that fit my criteria
```

```
GIVEN the password generator app

WHEN I click on the "generate password" button
THEN I can see pop up windows where I can specify the password length and the types of characters I want to include

WHEN I specify all the criteria,
THEN I can see a corresponding password on the screen

```

### âœ… Acceptance Criteria

It's done when:

- [ ] the user select a password length between 10 and 64
- [ ] the user select at least 1 character type to be included in the password
- [ ] a password respecting user's criteria is generated

## ðŸ”§ TECHNOLOGY USED

- Starter code: HTML and CSS
- I worked on : JavaScript

### ðŸ’¡ What I've learnt

- Array manipulation and JavaScript Math Object: using methods such splice() combined with Math.random(), to randomly generate characters to be included in the password

### âž• Suggestions for improvement

- Do some DRY improvements, especially in the do...while loop in the getpassword() function

## ðŸš€ INSTALLATION

No installation needed.
